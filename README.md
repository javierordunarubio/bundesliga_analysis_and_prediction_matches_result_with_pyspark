# Bundesliga analysis and match result prediction 

**Programming language used: Python (PySpark)**

In this notebook we are going to make an **analysis of some data of the first football division in Germany using Pyspark**, extracting some information of each season: champions of the league year by year, relegated ones of each season and season with more goals. We'll also see the teams with more economic power and the stadiums with more capacity. Finally, we will build a **simple ML pipeline also with Pyspark using a Random Forest** with which we'll try to predict the results of the football matches with some independent variables (this will be very difficult, as we'll see later).
